This is a selfie app written for a digital art class using Processing.

Artist's Statement:

With the advent of social media, we can manipulate and control others perceptions of our identities more specifically than ever before. By picking and choosing which pictures appear on our profile, which topics to mention in status updates and blog posts, which personal information to display, and what we comment on other people’s posts, we can make ourselves look more attractive, interesting, accomplished, and intelligent.  Thus, on social media, we create an idealized version of ourselves, emphasizing our best qualities and downplaying our less desirable traits.

By obscuring the self, my work deflates this idealized creation of self. Therefore, using the programming language Processing, I created a photo-taking app that allows the user to apply filters to their photo. These filters, however, only serve to degrade the quality of the photo and increasingly obscure their image, rather than enhancing it.  Unlike social media, my app is not flexible and does not allow users to selectively choose which filters to use and which to not use—once a filter is applied, the user cannot undo their choice. As the user continues to apply filters, their image becomes less and less recognizable, until they fade into obscurity.  

I hope that the users of my app will consider their relationship with social media, and think about whether their online presence serves to glorify and glamorize their lives beyond reality.
